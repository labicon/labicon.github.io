Kartik is a PhD Student in Mechanical Engineering at UC Berkeley. He recently graduated with a B.S. in Computational Engineering from University of Texas at Austin, where he developed a background in Optimization, Controls, and Orbital Mechanics. Now, his research is focused on safety for robotic systems and multi-agent reinforcement learning problems. He is particularly interested in elucidating the black box models of machine learning to more meaningully and safely apply these method to complex real world systems.
