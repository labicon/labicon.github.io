Seoyeon Choi is a PhD Student in Mechanical Engineering at University of California, Berkeley. She received B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Yonsei University in South Korea where she worked on MPCs and RL for autonomous driving and contact-rich manipulation. Her current research interests lie in robot learning, especially on how LLMs and VLMs can guide reinforcement learning to acquire complex, coordinated robot behaviors.
