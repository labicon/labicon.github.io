Ryan Park is a PhD Student in Mechanical Engineering at UC Berkeley. He graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science from the University of Texas at Austin. While there, he worked in Dr. David Fridovich-Keil's Control and Learning for Autonomous Robots (CLeAR) Lab doing work on modelling multi-agent interactions using dynamic game theory. Specifically, Ryan worked on inverse games and belief-space games. In the ICON Lab, his research continues to focus on multi-agent interactions while incorporating modern machine learning methods.
