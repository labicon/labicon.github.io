## Join the <u>I</u>ntelligent <u>Con</u>trol Lab

Thank you for your interest in our research! We are actively seeking motivated new talent and strongly encourage students from diverse backgrounds to apply. Due to the high volume of inquiries we receive, we are unable to respond to every message individually, but we appreciate your interest.

Please review the following guidelines based on your current status:

<u>Current UC Berkeley Undergraduates:</u>
If you are already a student at Berkeley and wish to join the lab, please <a href="https://forms.gle/mnma3Y8DgmGoNPW36">complete this application form</a> and feel free to send a brief follow-up email. We typically review applications and schedule in-person interviews with selected candidates on a rolling basis, and especially at the start of each semester.

<u>Prospective Graduate Students:</u>
Please apply through the formal UC Berkeley graduate admissions process. We look for self-motivated students with strong foundations in robotics, computer vision, and machine learning. You do not need to contact us directly at this stage; instead, please highlight your interest in our lab within your Statement of Purpose.

<u>Postdoctoral Applicants, Visiting Scholars, & Research Interns:</u>
We are currently updating our application system, and the specific forms for these roles will be posted here soon. In the meantime, please <i>email the PI, Negar Mehr, directly</i> with your CV, a cover letter, and a list of 3–5 references (or your research proposal for visiting positions) to express your interest.
