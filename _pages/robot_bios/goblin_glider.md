Goblin Glider is our custom quadcopter designed for full on-board policy deployment. This drone is equipped with a Nvidia Jetson Orin NX for policy computation, a Pixhawk 6c Mini flight controller, and a KAYAM speed controller. This robotic platform is still in development.

Goblin Glider is named after the hoverboard that Green Goblin use in the "Spiderman" comics.
