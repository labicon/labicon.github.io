Jeevan is a 29-DOF Unitree G1 humanoid robot equipped with Dex3 hands, capable of dexterous manipulation and whole-body control.

Jeevan takes its name from the Hindi word for life. The word Jeevan represents vitality, spirit, and the essence of living—an apt namesake for a robot built to explore dynamic, life-like movement and human-centered interaction.
